Minimum threshold of sustained engagement over 3-month periods with measurable contributions (pull requests, issue reports, meeting participation).
- Commercial deployment of CAMARA-based services
  - Organizations actively deploying, reselling, or providing services based on CAMARA APIs to third parties. This includes telecommunications operators offering CAMARA-compliant services, system integrators building solutions, or cloud providers exposing telecom capabilities through CAMARA specifications.
- Standards alignment (GSMA, TMForum, 3GPP participation)
  - Organizations participating in complementary standards bodies (GSMA, TMForum, 3GPP) with demonstrated commitment to telecom API standardization and interoperability. This recognizes broader ecosystem participants who support CAMARA's mission through adjacent activities.
